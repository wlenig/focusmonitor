# FocusMonitor

WIP tool for monitor global focus in Windows. Initially developed to troubleshoot a pesky Windows 11 focus bug.

### Building

Building requires MSVC. Open Visual Studio Developer Console and run `make.bat`; outputs can be found in `/bin`.

### Usage

Build, then run `bin/main.exe`. In the future, portable builds will be provided.

> [!WARNING]
> FocusMonitor uses SetWindowsHookEx and loads an unsigned DLL into running processes. Both anti-cheats and anti-viruses do not take kindly to such behavior, so exercise caution with the already running processes on your computer.
