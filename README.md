# FocusMonitor

WIP tool for monitor global focus in Windows. Initially developed to troubleshoot a pesky Windows 11 focus bug.

### Building

Building requires MSVC. Open Visual Studio Developer Console and run `make.bat`; outputs can be found in `/bin`.

### Usage

Build, then run `bin/main.exe`. In the future, portable builds will be provided.
